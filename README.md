The tUtor SearCher application is made for two different types of users: tutor and tutee.
<h3>Register</h3>
After running the application, click the “Register” button on the home page to be redirected to the Registration view. Here all fields must be entered along with a radio button value indicating whether the registering user is a tutor or a tutee.  Once the form has been submitted, an email will be sent to the indicated usc email address.  The link in the verification email must be clicked in order to proceed with using the application.
<h3>Login</h3>
In order to login, please enter the email address and password used during registration. If the email has not been verified (by clicking the link), the user will not be able to log in and a verification email will be resent to the email address on file.  In testing, because USC email servers respond much more slowly than other tier 1 email servers (such as Gmail and Yahoo), please be patient if you have not yet received the verification email.

<h3>Tutee</h3>
After logging in, you will be redirected to the Tutee Homepage. On this page, every single open tutoring request that you have made will be displayed and you will be able to see the status of the request.
